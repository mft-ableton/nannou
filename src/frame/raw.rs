/// Allows the user to draw a single **RawFrame** to the surface of a window.
///
/// The application's **view** function is called each time the application is ready to retrieve a
/// new image that will be displayed to a window. The **RawFrame** type can be thought of as the
/// canvas to which you draw this image.
///
/// ## Under the hood - Vulkan
///
/// There are a couple of main goals for the **RawFrame** type:
///
/// - Allow for maximum flexibility and customisation over the:
///   - Render Pass
///   - Graphics Pipeline
///   - Framebuffer Creation and
///   - Command Buffer
///   to the extent that the user may not interfere with the expected behaviour of the **App**.
/// - Provide reasonable defaults for each step so that it is friendly for new users.
///
/// **Vulkan**
///
/// Nannou uses Vulkan for interacting with the available graphics devices on a machine and for
/// presenting images to the swapchain associated with each window. It does so via the **vulkano**
/// crate, which is exposed publicly from the crate root. **vulkano** aims to be a type-safe,
/// near-zero-cost API around the low-level Vulkan API. As a result **vulkano** tends to be a lot
/// nicer than using the Vulkan API directly where it is the role of the user to maintain all the
/// invariants described within the spec themselves. Due to this higher-level nature, nannou
/// exposes the vulkano API directly in some areas where it is deemed reasonable/safe to do so.
///
/// In order to provide maximum flexibility, nannou allows for fully custom
/// [**RenderPass**](https://docs.rs/vulkano/latest/vulkano/framebuffer/struct.RenderPass.html) and
/// [**GraphicsPipeline**](https://docs.rs/vulkano/latest/vulkano/pipeline/struct.GraphicsPipeline.html)
/// via the **vulkano** API but aims to take care of the surface creation, swapchain tedium and
/// rendering synchronisation behind the scenes.
///
/// ### Render Pass and Swapchain Framebuffers.
///
/// The render pass describes the destination for the output of the graphics pipeline. It is
/// essential that the render pass uses the same pixel format of the window's surface. It also must
/// be initialised with the same logical device with which the surface was initialised.
///
/// For now, it is up to the user to ensure these gaurantees are met. In the future nannou may
/// provide a simplified constructor that implicitly uses the same logical device and format
/// associated with the surface.
///
/// The user can create the framebuffers for the swapchain using this render pass by using the
/// **SwapchainFramebuffers** type. While under the hood there is no distinction between the
/// Framebuffer type used to draw to a swapchain image and any other image, nannou chooses to wrap
/// these framebuffers in a type to ensure the following invariants are met:
///
/// - There must be one framebuffer per swapchain image.
/// - Each framebuffer must be recreated to match the dimensions of the swapchain each time the
///   swapchain requires recreation. This will occur any time the window is resized on desktop or
///   when an app comes in or out of focus on Android, and possibly in many other cases not
///   mentioned here.
/// - It should be impossible to write to these framebuffers outside the **view** function to
///   ensure framebuffer availability.
/// - Each call to **view** must draw to the framebuffer associated with the image that is ready as
///   indicated by the `swapchain::acquire_next_image` function.
///
/// As a result, access to the swapchain framebuffers may feel relatively restrictive. If you
/// require greater flexibility (e.g. control over framebuffer dimensions, the ability to draw to a
/// framebuffer outside the **view** function, etc) then consider creating and writing to another
/// intermediary framebuffer before drawing to the swapchain framebuffers.
///
/// See [the vulkano documenation](https://docs.rs/vulkano/latest/vulkano/framebuffer/index.html)
/// for more details on render passes and framebuffers.
///
/// ### Graphics Pipeline
///
/// The role of the `GraphicsPipeline` is similar to that of the GL "program" but much more
/// detailed and explicit. It allows for describing and chaining together a series of custom
/// shaders.
///
/// For more information on the graphics pipeline and how to create one, see [the vulkano
/// documentation](https://docs.rs/vulkano/latest/vulkano/pipeline/index.html#creating-a-graphics-pipeline).
///
/// ### Command Buffer
///
/// The API for the **Frame** type maps directly onto a vulkano `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` under
/// the hood. This `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` is created using the `primary_one_time_submit`
/// constructor. When returned, the **App** will build the command buffer and submit it to the GPU.
/// Note that certain builder methods are *not* provided in order to avoid unexpected behaviour.
/// E.g. the `build` and submit methods are not provided as it is important that the **App** is
/// able to build the command buffer and synchronise its submission with the swapchain.
///
/// Use the **frame.add_commands()** method to begin chaining together commands. You may call this
/// more than once throughout the duration of the **view** function.
///
/// See [the vulkano
/// documentation](https://docs.rs/vulkano/latest/vulkano/command_buffer/index.html) for more
/// details on how command buffers work in vulkano.
///
/// **Note:** If you find you are unable to do something or that this API is too restrictive,
/// please open an issue about it so that might be able to work out a solution!
